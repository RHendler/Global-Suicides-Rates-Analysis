Hi! My name is Roi Hendler. I'm a master student for Ecology, Evolution and Nature
 Conservation at the University of Potsdam and a freelance R & Shiny developer. 
I specialize in statistical analysis & modeling and I believe that in order to understand and research data it is extremely 
helpful visualize it efficiently and experiment with it by using an interactive UI.
